Reddit AMA Helper - HackIllinois
=====
The basic idea for this (quick) project was to build something that would text a phone when an AMA (or any thread on Reddit, for that matter) was just getting popular- at the time, we decided that this was right after a thread got past a certain number of upvotes (which worked surprisingly well), so the code has no real "algorithm", especially considering that between Apr 2013 and now, Reddit has changed its own voting system. Despite that, it was a fun project and it's marginally useful- at least, it keeps you from having to wait and refresh pages. 

  We handled texting through a GMail account- text in to the account, the account adds you to a list, and you recieve texts about threads back.
  
Room for improvement:
  Ability to turn subscription on/off/watch out for certain threads in advance. 
  Create a real algorithm.
